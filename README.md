# Mangrove-species-Dominance-Simulator
This is the Java-based code (in AnyLogic) for the model MaDS (Mangrove species Dominance Simulator), an agent-based model that simulates the structures of mixed mangrove forest stands by considering specific responses of mangrove species to shading, salinity, and inundation frequencies.
